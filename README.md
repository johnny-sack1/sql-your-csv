# SQL your Google Sheets

The goal was to write a program which will allow users to query their google sheet files using SQL. Google sheet tables should act as tables in the RDBMS.

Functionality:

 - selecting which columns should be displayed (SELECT * FROM xyz.csv; should also work).
 - filtering data (using WHERE, >, <, =, <>, LIKE, AND, OR)
